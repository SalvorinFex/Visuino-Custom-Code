---Custom_Code_Flip_Flop---

This is a simple "Flip Flop" recreation.
It takes typed user input and matches it to defined compare components.

Current input Selections:
Help - Display the menu
Enable - Turn on the output pin
Disable - Turn it off

There are no variables used, it only uses clocks.
For each input pin there is the "On Data" area that switches the output pin.
It then displays it's actions with a text output pin to the serial monitor.
This also turns the Pin-13 Arduino LED on and off.

Enjoy

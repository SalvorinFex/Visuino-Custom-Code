# Visuino-Custom-Code
This repo is for sharing Custom Code samples for the Visuino, Custom Code Component.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to do so. In that case you sign up for an account on Github and fork this project:  https://github.com/SalvorinFex/Visuino-Custom-Code

After that you can add files in your new forked repository. When done you make a Pull Request so your content shows up in the main repo.
The pull request must be audited by someone with write access before it can be viewed in the "main" repo.

When adding files you name them to something matching the function your Custom Code component does. Make a folder with your name on (or similar) in which you put your files. Also add a exported image from your project that you give the same name as your file. This makes it easier to see what the project contains without downloading and opening the file.

Do NOT remove or change anyone elses files without their approval. This makes everything easier to admin when someone asks for a pull request.

What Git-software you use is up to you. There are plenty of tutorials "out there".
Down below you can see a step by step instruction on how to fork our repo and make a pull request.
